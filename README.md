# Stock-Price-Prediction-with-LSTM---RNN-Deep-Learning

This repository contains code for predicting stock prices using a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model. The LSTM model is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can effectively capture temporal dependencies in sequential data, making it suitable for time series forecasting tasks.

# Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop a predictive model that can forecast future stock prices based on historical data. The model utilizes LSTM layers to learn patterns and trends from the training data and make predictions for future time periods.

# Dataset
The dataset used for training and evaluation is the historical stock price data of Google (GOOGL). The dataset is divided into a training set and a test set. The training set contains stock price data from 2012 to 2016, while the test set includes stock price data for the month of January 2017.

# Methodology
Data preprocessing: The training set is preprocessed by applying feature scaling to normalize the stock price values between 0 and 1. This step ensures that the data is in a suitable range for the LSTM model.

Creating input sequences: The training data is transformed into input sequences with a sliding window approach. Each input sequence consists of a fixed number of previous stock prices, which serve as inputs, and the next stock price as the output to be predicted.

Building the LSTM model: The LSTM model is constructed with multiple LSTM layers and dropout regularization to prevent overfitting. The model learns from the input sequences to capture patterns and dependencies in the data.

Training the model: The LSTM model is trained on the preprocessed training data using the Adam optimizer and mean squared error loss. The training process involves running the model for a fixed number of epochs and adjusting the weights to minimize the prediction error.

Making predictions: After training, the model is used to make predictions on the test set. The input sequences for the test set are generated similarly to the training set, and the model predicts the stock prices for the month of January 2017.

Visualization: The predicted stock prices are compared with the actual stock prices from the test set. The results are visualized using a line plot to demonstrate the model's performance in predicting stock prices.

Results
The model's performance can be assessed by comparing the predicted stock prices with the actual stock prices from the test set. The visualization plot shows the predicted and actual stock prices for the month of January 2017.

# Limitations and Future Improvements
The model uses historical data to predict future stock prices, assuming that the underlying patterns and trends remain consistent. However, stock markets are highly volatile and influenced by various factors, making accurate predictions challenging.
Future improvements could include incorporating additional
